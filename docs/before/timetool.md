# Timing Ultrafast X-ray and Optical Pulses at LCLS
When performing time-resolved experiments a key consideration is the temporal resolution of the measurements being made. The time resolution must be high enough in order to study the relevant processes under investigation. The X-ray pulses generated by the LCLS are ultrashort, on the order of a few tens of femtoseconds, even reaching attosecond ranges in certain operational modes. In principle, this means that the LCLS can be used to investigate chemical and physical phenomena on the femtosecond timescale - the timescale of nuclear and electronic motion. Coupled with the use of ultrafast optical lasers fundamental light-induced processes can be interrogated with high spatial, temporal, and spectroscopic resolution.
