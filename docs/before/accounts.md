# HPC Center Access

This guide contains information on how to access computational
resources at HPC centers, including advice and links to
more authoratitive procedures for both SLAC/LCLS and external laboratories.
Most of these systems have separate account creation processes
at present.  So, it's necessary to complete steps at each
center where you are collaborating.

The DOE-integrated research infrastructure (IRI) vision
is to empower researchers to more easily use appropriate experimental
and computing resources within the DOE science ecosystem
